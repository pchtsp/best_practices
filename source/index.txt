Best practices
=========================================

This is just some notes I have that can help get basic IT / programming things for people that do not have the time to search over 10 different pages and 50 stackoverflow questions.
I focus on Linux bash, R and python for the time being. The idea is not to make it for everything. Only for things I care and know.
