Technical documentation
************************

To produce good documentation, both style and structure of content is important.

Styling
===================

The `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ documentation engine is quite good.

More detailed examples `here <https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html>`_.

Options for styling are markdown or reStructuredText. Apparently, the latter is the recommended standard due to the fact that the first one is not even a standard. Sphinx has support for both.

This guide was created in Sphinx and reStructured Text (rst).

Structure
===================

Technical documentation can vary considerable between one project and another. An example of documentation for a mathematical-model-based application is the following.
